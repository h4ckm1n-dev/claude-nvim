# Claude Plugin Fixes Summary

## 🎯 All Issues Fixed Successfully

### 1. **Claude CLI Path Configuration** ✅
- **Issue**: Plugin was configured to use `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude` but system has Claude at `/Users/h4ckm1n/.claude/local/claude`
- **Fix**: Updated default path in `lua/claude/init.lua:10`
- **Result**: Plugin now uses correct Claude CLI path

### 2. **Missing Keymap Functions** ✅
- **Issue**: 5 keymap functions were missing implementations:
  - `send_git_diff`
  - `send_selection`
  - `copy_response`
  - `execute_with_line`
  - `send_buffer`
- **Fix**: Implemented all missing functions in `lua/claude/init.lua`
- **Result**: All keymaps now work correctly

### 3. **Git Integration Issues** ✅
- **Issue**: Git context and branch detection were failing
- **Fix**: Enhanced git functions in `lua/claude/utils/context.lua`:
  - Added repository validation
  - Multiple git diff strategies
  - Better error handling
  - Improved logging
- **Result**: Git integration now works properly

### 4. **Visual Selection Issues** ✅
- **Issue**: Visual selection failed in headless mode
- **Fix**: Enhanced `get_visual_selection()` in `lua/claude/utils/context.lua`:
  - Added mode detection
  - Better fallback to previous selection
  - Improved error handling
- **Result**: Visual selection works in both interactive and headless modes

### 5. **Comprehensive Logging** ✅
- **Issue**: No debugging mechanism for troubleshooting
- **Fix**: Added complete logging system:
  - New `lua/claude/utils/logger.lua` module
  - Logging throughout all functions
  - Log file rotation and management
  - User commands for log access
- **Result**: Full debugging capabilities
